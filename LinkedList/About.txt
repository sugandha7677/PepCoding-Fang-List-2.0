a linked list is a non-continuous type of data structure. 
This means that a Linked List utilizes space when there is a fragmented memory.

Disadvantage of Linked List over Arrays in terms of memory :

Even though it is advantageous to use Linked Lists for space conservation in heap,
 we notice that since each node stores 2 values: data and address, therefore each node 
requires 4bytes+ 4 bytes=8 bytes of memory. The memory used in arrays for each
element was only 4 bytes. Here, the space of linked lists is noticed to be more.
